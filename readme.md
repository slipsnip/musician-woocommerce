# Woocommerce customisations for Wordpress theme musician (private)

## Description

Originaly a fork of [woothemes/theme-customisations (github)](http://github.com/woothemes/theme-customisations "woothemes/theme-customisations (github)") created to keep my customisations seperate from the theme.  Isolates Woocommerce customisations so that the theme can be updated without consequence.

Customisations are done using Wordpress Hooks, the recomended way to customise Woocommerce.

## Installation

1. Clone or upload `musician-woocommerce` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin in WordPress dashboard
3. Done!
